## 📱 HOW IT WORKS

### Responsive Calculation Engine

```dart
// 1. Screen Size Detection
final screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;   // e.g., 360px
final screenHeight = MediaQuery.of(context).size.height; // e.g., 800px

// 2. Percentage Calculations
responsive.wp(4)  = screenWidth * 0.04  = 14.4px
responsive.hp(2)  = screenHeight * 0.02 = 16px

// 3. Scaled Font Sizes (relative to iPhone X base)
responsive.sp(18) = 18 * (screenWidth / 375) = 17.28px

// 4. Safety Clamping (prevents extremes)
.clamp(16.0, 22.0) // Ensures min 16px, max 22px
```

### Example: Small vs Large Phone

**Small Phone (320px wide):**
```dart
responsive.wp(29) = 92.8px  → clamped to 100px (minimum)
responsive.sp(18) = 15.36px → clamped to 16px (minimum)
Result: Readable, no overflow
```

**Large Phone (430px wide):**
```dart
responsive.wp(29) = 124.7px → within range, used as-is
responsive.sp(18) = 20.64px → clamped to 22px (maximum)
Result: Well-sized, proportional
```
