# üèÜ AI Sports Talent Assessment Platform

### 1) Clone the repository

Open PowerShell and run (one-line):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Tarun-goswamii/AI-Powered-Sports-Assessment-Application.git ; cd "AI-Powered-Sports-Assessment-Application/src/FLUTTER KA CODEBASE/sports_assessment_app"
```

### 2) One-click installers (recommended)

To make demos and judging easy we provide three installer batch files in the project root. After cloning the repo, connect your target device (Android phone or Windows machine) and double-click the matching installer:

- `Install (Android).bat` ‚Äî Installs dependencies, prompts for `RESEND_API_KEY`, deploys Convex, and launches the app on a connected Android device or emulator.
- `Install (Windows).bat` ‚Äî Installs dependencies, prompts for `RESEND_API_KEY`, enables Windows desktop support, deploys Convex, and launches the Windows desktop build.
- `Install (iOS).bat` ‚Äî macOS helper that prints the exact iOS/macOS commands (iOS builds require macOS/Xcode). Run the printed commands on a macOS terminal.

What the batch files do:

- Install Node and Flutter dependencies (`npm install`, `flutter pub get`).
- Prompt for your `RESEND_API_KEY` and call `npx convex env set` to save it to the deployed Convex environment.
- Deploy the Convex backend (`npm run deploy`).
- Run `flutter run` for the selected target.

Notes & tips:

- First run will take longer because `npm` and Flutter will download packages and set up build artifacts.
- If `npx convex env set` fails because you're not logged in, run `npx convex login` once and then re-run the batch file.
- Ensure a device is connected (Android USB debugging enabled) or that you've enabled Windows desktop prerequisites (Visual Studio and Developer Mode) before running the corresponding batch file.

### 3) Mobile-specific prerequisites

- Android SDK (installed via Android Studio) with platform-tools
- USB drivers for your device (Windows)
- A physical Android device with USB debugging enabled, or an Android emulator (AVD)

### 4) Windows-specific prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Enable Developer Mode (Settings ‚Üí Update & Security ‚Üí For developers)
- Visual Studio with "Desktop development with C++" workload installed (required by Flutter Windows tooling)
- Flutter configured for Windows desktop support

Visual Studio install checklist

If you don't already have Visual Studio installed, install **Visual Studio Community (2022 or later)** and select the following during installation:

- Workload: "Desktop development with C++" (required)
  - Component: MSVC v143 (or latest) - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools
  - Component: Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0 or later)
  - Component: C++ CMake tools for Windows
  - Optional: Windows Universal C Runtime SDK

After installing Visual Studio, run:

```powershell
flutter doctor --windows
```

This will confirm the Windows toolchain is ready. If flutter doctor flags missing components, re-run Visual Studio Installer and add the missing items.

```powershell
npm run deploy
```

After deploy, Convex functions will be available at `https://<your-project>.convex.cloud` (the repo is preconfigured to use `fantastic-ibex-496.convex.cloud` when deployed there).

### 5) Run the Flutter app on Android (physical device)

Mobile-specific prerequisites

- Android SDK (installed via Android Studio) with platform-tools
- USB drivers for your device (Windows)
- A physical Android device with USB debugging enabled, or an Android emulator (AVD)

Steps to run on Android device

1. Enable USB debugging on your Android device.
2. Connect the device to your PC via USB.
3. Verify the device is detected:

```powershell
flutter devices
```

4. Run the app:

```powershell
flutter run
```

Use `r` for hot reload and `R` for full restart in the terminal.

### 6) Run the Flutter app on Windows (desktop)
Windows-specific prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Enable Developer Mode (Settings ‚Üí Update & Security ‚Üí For developers)
- Visual Studio with "Desktop development with C++" workload installed (required by Flutter Windows tooling)
- Flutter configured for Windows desktop support

Visual Studio install checklist

If you don't already have Visual Studio installed, install **Visual Studio Community (2022 or later)** and select the following during installation:

- Workload: "Desktop development with C++" (required)
  - Component: MSVC v143 (or latest) - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools
  - Component: Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0 or later)
  - Component: C++ CMake tools for Windows
  - Optional: Windows Universal C Runtime SDK

After installing Visual Studio, run:

```powershell
flutter doctor --windows
```

This will confirm the Windows toolchain is ready. If flutter doctor flags missing components, re-run Visual Studio Installer and add the missing items.

Enable Windows support and run:

```powershell
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
npx convex env set RESEND_API_KEY re_your_real_key_here # if not already set
flutter run -d windows
```

### 7) Helpful scripts & commands

- Deploy Convex + run app together:

```powershell
npm run deploy-and-run
```

- Run Convex locally in dev mode (auto reload):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

- Seed demo data (convenience):

```powershell
npm run seed-demo
```

### 8) Resend (Email) notes & Free tier limitations

- If your Resend account is on the Free tier, you can only send emails to verified addresses (sandbox mode). Domain verification alone does not remove this restriction.
- To send to arbitrary recipients, upgrade to Resend Transactional plan (click "Upgrade" on Resend dashboard).
- For demo/testing you can add test addresses to the allowlist at https://resend.com/settings/audiences or use the temporary workaround implemented in the repo that routes emails to your verified address while preserving the intended recipient in the subject line.

### 9) Common troubleshooting

- If Flutter build fails: run `flutter doctor -v` and resolve missing components.
- If Convex deployment fails: ensure you're logged in (`npx convex login`) and `RESEND_API_KEY` is set.
- If email requests return 403 sandbox errors: upgrade Resend or add test addresses to the allowlist.

// lib/features/ai_chat/ai_chat_screen.dart
class AIChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  // Voice mode with speech-to-text + VAPI + text-to-speech
  
  Future<void> _handleVoiceInteraction() async {
    // 1. User speaks into microphone
    final spokenText = await _speechToText.listen();
    
    // 2. Send to VAPI AI (Riley)
    final response = await VapiAIService.sendMessage(
      message: spokenText,
      assistantId: 'riley-sports-coach',
    );
    
    // 3. Riley responds with intelligent advice
    final coachingAdvice = response.message;
    
    // 4. Text-to-speech speaks Riley's response
    await _flutterTts.speak(coachingAdvice);
  }
}
```

#### **Example Conversations:**

üó£Ô∏è **Goal Setting:**
```
You: "I want to lose weight and build muscle"
Riley: "Great goals! For body recomposition, I recommend a moderate 
        calorie deficit (300-500 below maintenance) with high protein 
        (1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight). Focus on compound lifts 3-4x/week 
        combined with 2-3 cardio sessions. Let's start with your current 
        stats to create a personalized plan..."
```

üó£Ô∏è **Workout Guidance:**
```
You: "What's a good beginner workout?"
Riley: "Perfect! Let's start with a full-body routine, 3x per week. 
        Day 1: Squats (3√ó10), Push-ups (3√ó8), Rows (3√ó10), Planks (3√ó30s).
        Rest days are crucial for recovery. Can you do these at home or 
        do you have gym access?"
```

üó£Ô∏è **Form Correction:**
```
You: "My lower back hurts during squats"
Riley: "Lower back pain during squats often indicates form issues. 
        Check these: 1) Keep core braced throughout, 2) Don't let knees 
        cave inward, 3) Ensure you're hitting proper depth, 4) Keep chest up 
        and back neutral. Try reducing weight to master form first. 
        Would you like me to explain proper squat technique?"
```

üó£Ô∏è **Nutrition Advice:**
```
You: "What should I eat for muscle gain?"
Riley: "For muscle building, aim for a 300-500 calorie surplus with 
        high protein. Example meal plan: Breakfast: 4 eggs, oats, banana. 
        Lunch: Chicken breast, rice, vegetables. Dinner: Salmon, sweet potato, 
        greens. Snacks: Greek yogurt, nuts, protein shakes. Track your 
        progress weekly and adjust based on results!"
```

#### **Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
// VAPI Configuration - config/app_config.dart
class AppConfig {
  // VAPI credentials
  static const String vapiPrivateKey = 'fc94f501-d001-4551-97f8-46785c3b025d';

### üí° **Pro Tips**

1. **Keep Convex Dev Running**: Always keep `npx convex dev` running in a separate terminal for real-time backend updates

2. **Use VS Code Extensions**:
   - Flutter
   - Dart
   - Flutter Widget Snippets
   - Error Lens

3. **Enable Hot Reload**: Press `r` in terminal after code changes for instant updates (no rebuild needed!)

4. **Check Logs**: Use `flutter logs` in separate terminal to see real-time app logs

5. **Profile Performance**: Run `flutter run --profile` to check app performance

6. **Clear Cache**: If things get weird, run:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```
