@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final responsive = ResponsiveUtils(context);
  
  return Container(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(responsive.wp(5)),  // 5% of width
    child: Text(
      'Hello',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: responsive.sp(24),  // Scalable text
      ),
