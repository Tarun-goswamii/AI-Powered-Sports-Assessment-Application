    const assessmentId = await ctx.db.insert("assessments", {
      ...args,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      synced: true,
    });
    
    // Automatically update leaderboards
    await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, api.leaderboards.updateRankings, {
      exerciseType: args.exerciseType
    });
    
    return assessmentId;
  },
});

// convex/community.ts - Real-time activity feed

    // Reactive query - automatically updates UI when data changes
    const activities = await ctx.db
      .query("activities")
      .order("desc")
      .take(50);
    return activities;
  },
});

      .collect();
    
    return {
      totalWorkouts: assessments.length,
      averageScore: calculateAverage(assessments, 'formScore'),
      personalBests: calculatePRs(assessments),
      weeklyProgress: calculateTrend(assessments, 7),

          </div>
        `,
      }),
    });
    
    return response.ok;
  },
});

// convex/analytics.ts - Weekly growth report
export const sendWeeklyGrowthReport = internalMutation({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const stats = await ctx.db.query("users")
      .filter((q) => q.gte(q.field("createdAt"), Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000))

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VAPI_AI-Voice_Coaching-6A0DAD?style=for-the-badge&logo=microphone&logoColor=white" alt="VAPI AI"/>
</div>

#### **What is VAPI AI?**
VAPI (Voice AI Platform Interface) is a cutting-edge conversational AI platform that enables natural voice interactions. It powers the voice coaching experience in our app, making fitness guidance accessible through simple conversations.

#### **What We're Doing with VAPI:**

🤖 **Meet Riley - Your AI Sports Coach**

Riley is our flagship AI assistant, a specialized sports coaching agent built on VAPI's platform. Riley is an expert in:

- **🎯 Goal Setting**: Helps athletes define SMART goals and create actionable plans
- **🏋️ Gym Training**: Provides workout routines for all fitness levels (beginner to advanced)
- **💪 Custom Workout Plans**: Designs personalized programs based on equipment, time, and goals
- **� Nutrition Guidance**: Offers meal planning, macro calculations, and dietary advice

- **🔥 Motivation**: Delivers encouragement, celebrates achievements, and keeps you going
- **📈 Assessment Interpretation**: Explains what your performance metrics mean and how to improve
- **🏃 Sport-Specific Training**: Specialized advice for different sports (running, strength, etc.)

#### **How Athletes Interact with Riley:**

**In-App Voice Chat (Current Implementation):**
```dart
// lib/features/ai_chat/ai_chat_screen.dart
class AIChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  // Voice mode with speech-to-text + VAPI + text-to-speech
  
  Future<void> _handleVoiceInteraction() async {
    // 1. User speaks into microphone
    final spokenText = await _speechToText.listen();
    
    // 2. Send to VAPI AI (Riley)
    final response = await VapiAIService.sendMessage(
      message: spokenText,
      assistantId: 'riley-sports-coach',
    );
    
    // 3. Riley responds with intelligent advice
    final coachingAdvice = response.message;
    
    // 4. Text-to-speech speaks Riley's response
    await _flutterTts.speak(coachingAdvice);
  }
}
```

**Example Conversations:**

🗣️ **Goal Setting:**
```
You: "I want to lose weight and build muscle"
Riley: "Great goals! For body recomposition, I recommend a moderate 
        calorie deficit (300-500 below maintenance) with high protein 
        (1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight). Focus on compound lifts 3-4x/week 
        combined with 2-3 cardio sessions. Let's start with your current 
        stats to create a personalized plan..."
```

🗣️ **Workout Guidance:**
```
You: "What's a good beginner workout?"
Riley: "Perfect! Let's start with a full-body routine, 3x per week. 
        Day 1: Squats (3×10), Push-ups (3×8), Rows (3×10), Planks (3×30s).
        Rest days are crucial for recovery. Can you do these at home or 
        do you have gym access?"
```

🗣️ **Form Correction:**
```
You: "My lower back hurts during squats"
Riley: "Lower back pain during squats often indicates form issues. 
        Check these: 1) Keep core braced throughout, 2) Don't let knees 
        cave inward, 3) Ensure you're hitting proper depth, 4) Keep chest up 
        and back neutral. Try reducing weight to master form first. 
        Would you like me to explain proper squat technique?"
```

🗣️ **Nutrition Advice:**
```
You: "What should I eat for muscle gain?"
Riley: "For muscle building, aim for a 300-500 calorie surplus with 
        high protein. Example meal plan: Breakfast: 4 eggs, oats, banana. 
        Lunch: Chicken breast, rice, vegetables. Dinner: Salmon, sweet potato, 
        greens. Snacks: Greek yogurt, nuts, protein shakes. Track your 
        progress weekly and adjust based on results!"
```

#### **Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
// VAPI Configuration - config/app_config.dart
class AppConfig {
  // VAPI credentials
  static const String vapiPrivateKey = 'fc94f501-d001-4551-97f8-46785c3b025d';

  static const String vapiBaseUrl = 'https://api.vapi.ai';
}

// services/vapi_ai_service.dart - Intelligent Response System
class VapiAIService {
  // 200+ contextual responses across multiple categories
  Future<ChatResponse> sendMessage({required String message}) async {
    try {
      // Attempt VAPI API call first
      final response = await _dio.post('/chat', data: {
        'message': {'role': 'user', 'content': message},
        'assistantId': AppConfig.vapiAssistantId,
      });
      return ChatResponse.fromJson(response.data);
    } catch (e) {
      // Graceful fallback to intelligent local responses
      return _getFallbackResponse(message);
    }
  }
  
  // Smart pattern matching with 200+ varied responses
  ChatResponse _getFallbackResponse(String message) {
    final lowerMessage = message.toLowerCase();
    
    // Category detection: workout, nutrition, motivation, etc.
    if (lowerMessage.contains('workout') || lowerMessage.contains('exercise')) {
      return _getWorkoutAdvice(lowerMessage);
    }
    // ... 10+ categories with 10-30 variations each
  }
}
```
