flutter build apk --release

# 2. Or build App Bundle (recommended)
flutter build appbundle --release

# Output: build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

#### For iOS App Store:
```powershell
# Build iOS app (requires macOS)
flutter build ios --release
flutter build ipa
```

#### For Web Deployment:
```powershell
flutter build web --release
# Output: build/web/
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES (NON-BLOCKING)

### 1. ML Service Helper Methods Missing
**Impact:** Medium  
**Status:** Not blocking build  
**Affected:** Real-time pose analysis may return placeholder data  
**Workaround:** App uses server-side ML processing as fallback  
**Priority:** Can be fixed post-launch

### 2. Enhanced Recording Screen Errors
**Impact:** Low  
**Status:** Alternative screen; standard recording works  
**Affected:** Enhanced UI features  
**Workaround:** Use standard recording_screen.dart (fully functional)  
**Priority:** Enhancement for v2.0

### 3. Unused Imports (~500 warnings)
**Impact:** None  
**Status:** Code cleanup opportunity  
**Affected:** Code maintainability only  
**Workaround:** Not needed - doesn't affect functionality  
**Priority:** Low - clean up during maintenance

### 4. Responsive UI Coverage 71.4%
**Impact:** Very Low  
**Status:** All critical paths covered  
**Affected:** 10 alternative/experimental screens  
**Workaround:** Primary screens fully responsive  
**Priority:** Low - complete remaining screens post-launch
