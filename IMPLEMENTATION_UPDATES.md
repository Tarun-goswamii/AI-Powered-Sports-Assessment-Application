## üì¶ Packages Added

```yaml
dependencies:
  fl_chart: ^1.1.0                    # Analytics charts (pie, line, bar)
  syncfusion_flutter_charts: ^31.1.19 # Additional chart options
  speech_to_text: ^7.3.0              # Voice input for chatbot
```

## üé® Theme Consistency

All new features maintain the purple theme:
- **Royal Purple**: `#6A0DAD` - Primary accent
- **Purple Variant**: `#9333EA` - Secondary accent
- Charts use purple gradients
- Voice button uses orange/green gradient
- Red gradient when actively listening

## üîß Technical Details

### Analytics Implementation
```dart
// Pass test results to charts
PerformanceLineChart(testResults: _testResults)
PerformancePieChart(testResults: _testResults)
SportPerformanceBar(testResults: _testResults)

// Charts handle empty data gracefully
// Show sample data if no real data available
```

### Voice Input Implementation
```dart
// Initialize speech recognition
_speechToText = stt.SpeechToText();
await _speechToText.initialize();

// Toggle listening
await _speechToText.listen(
  onResult: (result) {
    _messageController.text = result.recognizedWords;
  },
  listenFor: Duration(seconds: 30),
  pauseFor: Duration(seconds: 3),
);
```

### Mentor Service Enhancement
```dart
// Handle both response formats
final List<dynamic> mentorsData = response.data is List 
  ? response.data 
  : (response.data['mentors'] as List? ?? []);
```

## üöÄ How to Test

### Analytics Tab
1. Go to Results screen
2. Tap "Analytics" tab
3. View three charts:
   - Line chart: Performance over time
   - Pie chart: Score distribution
   - Bar chart: Average by sport
4. If no data, see sample charts

### Voice Input
1. Open AI Chat screen
2. Tap microphone button (left of send)
3. Speak your question
4. Watch text appear in real-time
5. Tap mic again to stop or wait for auto-stop
6. Edit if needed, then send

### Mentors Fix
1. Go to Mentors screen
2. If no mentors load, see helpful error message
3. Tap "Retry" button to try again
4. Check console for detailed logs

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Speech Recognition**:
   - Requires microphone permissions
   - May not work on some emulators
   - Best tested on physical devices

2. **Mentors Loading**:
   - Depends on Convex backend being deployed
   - May show empty state if backend not configured
   - Check console logs for detailed errors

3. **Charts**:
   - Sample data shown when no real test results
   - Date formatting may vary by locale
   - Large datasets may need pagination

## üì± Testing Checklist

- [ ] Analytics charts display correctly
- [ ] Charts handle empty data gracefully
- [ ] Voice input button appears in chat
- [ ] Microphone permission requested
- [ ] Speech recognized correctly
- [ ] Text appears in input field
- [ ] Mentors screen shows retry option
- [ ] Purple theme consistent throughout
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] App builds successfully

## üéØ Performance Considerations

- Charts use lazy loading for large datasets
- Speech recognition auto-stops to save battery
- Convex service caches mentor data
- Analytics tab only loads when viewed
- Images lazy-loaded in charts

## üîê Permissions Required

### Android (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`)
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS (`ios/Runner/Info.plist`)
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for voice input</string>
```
