# AI Sports Talent Assessment Platform

## Problem We're Solving

Millions of talented athletes in India never get discovered because they lack access to proper coaching and standardized assessment tools. Traditional sports talent scouting is expensive, inconsistent, and only reaches urban areas. Young athletes in rural regions have incredible potential but no way to prove their abilities or track their progress scientifically.

Our platform democratizes sports assessment by bringing AI-powered analysis directly to any smartphone, creating equal opportunities for talent discovery across the entire nation.

## How the App Works

1. **Record Your Performance**: Athletes use their phone camera to record standardized fitness tests (push-ups, squats, sit-ups, vertical jumps, shuttle runs)

2. **AI Analyzes in Real-Time**: Advanced computer vision tracks 33+ body landmarks at 30fps, automatically counting reps and analyzing form with Olympic-level precision

3. **Get Instant Feedback**: Voice AI coach provides real-time motivation and detailed performance insights through natural conversation

4. **Track Progress**: Beautiful analytics dashboard shows improvement over time with interactive charts and personalized recommendations

5. **Connect & Compete**: Join community challenges, connect with certified mentors, and climb national leaderboards
