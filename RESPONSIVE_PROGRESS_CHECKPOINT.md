3. 🎯 Convert ProfileScreen (full responsive implementation)
4. 🎯 Convert CommunityScreen (full responsive implementation)

### Short Term (Medium Priority)

6. Convert store, leaderboard, and other feature screens
7. Final build and analysis checkpoint

### Final Steps
8. Convert enhanced/alternative screen variants
9. Full app build verification
10. Comprehensive testing across multiple device sizes
11. Update final documentation

## 🎯 GOAL
**Target:** 100% responsive conversion for all screens and widgets
**Approach:** Systematic, file-by-file conversion using ResponsiveUtils
**Quality:** Zero pixel overflow errors, consistent responsive behavior

## 📝 NOTES
- All converted files use `ResponsiveUtils(context)` for responsive scaling
- Pattern: `responsive.wp()` for width, `responsive.hp()` for height, `responsive.sp()` for text
- Clamp() used where needed to prevent extreme scaling
- Settings screen was rewritten due to corruption during conversion
